Wow, I was new to all this when I asked the above. No, Git Bash isn't a text editor, it's a Windows version of the git facility on Unix, and only handles the file versioning. git add, git rm, and other git commands just handle how the version control file manager handles the files and folders, and the only things it changes as a result are in a hidden folder named .git. Sorry if this has confused anyone.
