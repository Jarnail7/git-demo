#Demo Git Repository

This is the first paragraph

## Ipsum Below 

Wow, I was new to all this when I asked the above. No, Git Bash isn't a text editor, it's a Windows version of the git facility on Unix, and only handles the file versioning. git add, git rm, and other git commands just handle how the version control file manager handles the files and folders, and the only things it changes as a result are in a hidden folder named .git. Sorry if this has confused anyone.


I was confused at the time because, as the name suggests, Git Bash has bash shell commands shipped with it, not just git - e.g. ls (list files), mkdir (make new folder), and -- what I was looking for -- touch (make a new file or update timestamp on existing file), and echo (print text to the command line, or direct that text to a file).
